				<h2>Getting Together</h2>
				<div class="textnimg">
					<p>Built legos together as friends, had late night calls alone, and I even named your stuffed animals. Then we watched your favorite movie and ended up cuddling. I was so happy that day and I still feel the same way I did when we were first together.</p>

				<h2>First Picture</h2>
				<div class = "textnimg">
					<p>To be honest I was really nervous about taking pictures. That's probably why it took us so long to take pictures together. But I also get caught up in the moment with you so easily. Either way I still love looking at photos of us and we need more.</p>

				<h2>I love you</h2>
				<p>I haven't said this enough but I love you. We have made so many good memories together and I can't wait to create more with you. There is so much that I want to give you and buy you and spoil you but with time. You truly make me feel so special and I just love you so much. Also sorry about this color palette my designer skills need some work so if you want me to change anything about it I got it easilyyyy.</p>
